# What's Mine is Yours

A music streaming service made with love.


Goals: 

To start: Create a privately accessed seamless music streaming site with the options of listening to full albums, creating playlists, and downloading said album/playlist*. 

*yea fucking right

To infinity: Open to public doors with licensed music. Not likely. More of a personal project, but who knows?



Functionality:

Click, search, browse, drag, play. Simple ripped-off idea. Ex: Grooveshark, Rdio, etc... The only difference is this music will be downloadable in the click of a button. 

Access:

Only those who wield the power of key master shall be allowed in (to start).
MYSQL based is all I know for that kinda shit.


Design:

The entire site should be as seamless as possible. Transitioning from 1 page to the other, as if it was all connected. Simple, large photos, sharp shapes. 
Slick as fuck overall. How bleak eh?
